## Setup & Installation

This directory documents key setup challenges encountered during
the deployment of the Wazuh SIEM lab.

Rather than installation steps, the focus is on:
- Errors encountered during setup
- Root cause analysis
- Correct remediation actions

These issues reflect real-world deployment challenges faced
in SOC and enterprise environments.
